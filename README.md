# Erlang Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks

[Erlang LS](https://erlang-ls.github.io/editors/vscode/) is a Visual Studio Code Extension for the Erlang Language Server.

[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis with support for Ruby, Node.js, Elixir, Erlang & more.

[EMQ X Broker](https://www.emqx.io/) is a fully open source, highly scalable, highly available distributed MQTT messaging broker for IoT, M2M and Mobile applications that can handle tens of millions of concurrent clients.

[Lumen](https://github.com/lumen/lumen) is a new compiler and runtime for BEAM languages, designed for WebAssembly.

[Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) is a small, fast and modern HTTP server for Erlang/OTP.

[Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) is a seamless multi-master syncing database with an intuitive HTTP/JSON API, designed for reliability.

[Ejabberd](https://www.process-one.net/en/ejabberd/) is a distributed, fault-tolerant technology that allows the creation of large-scale instant messaging applications. The server can reliably support thousands of simultaneous users on a single node and has been designed to provide exceptional standards of fault tolerance.

[Rustler](https://docs.rs/crate/rustler) is a library for writing Erlang NIFs in safe Rust code meaning there should be no ways to crash the BEAM (Erlang VM). The library provides facilities for generating the boilerplate for interacting with the BEAM, handles encoding and decoding of Erlang terms, and catches rust panics before they unwind into C.

[Tsung](https://github.com/processone/tsung) is a high-performance benchmark framework for various protocols including HTTP, XMPP, LDAP, etc.

[Alpaca](https://github.com/alpaca-lang/alpaca) is a statically typed, strict/eagerly evaluated, functional programming language for the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). 

[Manifold](https://github.com/discord/manifold) is a fast batch message passing between nodes for Erlang/Elixir.

[Lager](https://github.com/erlang-lager/lager) is a logging framework for Erlang/OTP.

[Hackney](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney) is a simple HTTP client in Erlang.
